# Pure Form

A pure JavaScript (ES5) Web Components that allows the creation of a web form from a JSON Schema.

## Why did you no build it using ES6 ?

Because I really dont like transpiling, it's an unnecessary overcomplication. JavaScript is a beautifully powerful language that has managed to bring the internet to the stage it's at today. I'm not against progression, I just like to keep things simple.
